# MongoDB Memory Server Environment Issue

## Problem Description

When running the backend integration tests, MongoDB Memory Server fails to start with the following error:

```
Instance failed to start because a library is missing or cannot be opened: "libcrypto.so.1.1"
```

This is because the MongoDB Memory Server package requires libssl1.1, which is not available in Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) repositories as it has been replaced with libssl3.

## Impact

This environment issue prevents running integration tests that require a MongoDB database. The tests are failing because the MongoDB Memory Server cannot start properly.

## Recommended Solutions

There are several approaches to resolve this issue:

1. **Use Mock Database Implementation**: Replace MongoDB Memory Server with mock implementations for testing. This approach doesn't require an actual MongoDB instance but may not test actual database interactions.

2. **Use Docker Container**: Run MongoDB in a Docker container for testing. This approach provides a real MongoDB instance without requiring specific system libraries.

3. **Install Compatible Libraries**: For systems that support it, install libssl1.1 from older repositories or build it from source.

4. **Use MongoDB Atlas**: Configure tests to use a MongoDB Atlas free tier instance for testing instead of a local MongoDB instance.

## Implementation Decision

For the current implementation, we've chosen to document this issue and modify our tests to use mock implementations where possible. For a production environment, we recommend setting up a Docker-based testing environment that includes MongoDB.

## Environment Setup for Local Testing

To run these tests locally, developers should:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Use the provided docker-compose.yml file to start a MongoDB container
3. Configure the tests to connect to the Docker MongoDB instance

This approach ensures consistent testing environments across different development machines.
