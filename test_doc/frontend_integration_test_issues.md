# Frontend Integration Test Issues

## Current Status

The frontend integration tests have been set up with the following components:

- Test environment configuration with Mock Service Worker
- Mock API handlers for authentication, profile, assessment, and pathway
- Test utilities for rendering components with React Testing Library
- Test files for auth, profile, assessment, and pathway modules

## Issues Encountered

When running the frontend integration tests, the following issues were encountered:

1. **JSX Syntax Errors**: The tests use JSX syntax which requires Babel configuration. We've added Babel dependencies and configuration, but still encountering syntax errors.

2. **Component Import Errors**: The tests are trying to import frontend components that might not exist or might not be accessible from the test files.

3. **Module Resolution Issues**: There are issues with resolving modules like `next/router`, `next-i18next`, and `zustand`. We've added these dependencies and configured mocks, but still having resolution issues.

## Suggested Path Forward

To resolve these issues and make the frontend integration tests work, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Verify Frontend Component Structure**: Ensure that the frontend components being tested (Login, ProfilePage, etc.) exist and match the expected structure in the test files.

2. **Create Mock Components**: If the actual frontend components are not yet implemented or are complex, create simplified mock components for testing purposes.

3. **Update Module Resolution**: Configure Jest to correctly resolve modules from the frontend directory. This might involve updating the `moduleDirectories` and `modulePaths` in the Jest configuration.

4. **Align Test Environment with Frontend**: Ensure that the test environment matches the frontend environment in terms of dependencies, configuration, and structure.

5. **Incremental Testing**: Start with simple tests that don't rely on complex components or dependencies, and gradually add more complex tests as issues are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Create a separate branch for frontend integration tests to avoid blocking other development work.
2. Implement the suggested path forward steps incrementally.
3. Document progress and issues encountered for future reference.
