# MongoDB Memory Server Issue in Backend Tests

## Issue Description

When running backend tests, the following error occurs consistently across all test files:

```
Instance Exited before being ready and without throwing an error!

at MongoInstance.<anonymous> (node_modules/mongodb-memory-server-core/src/util/MongoInstance.ts:338:13)
at MongoInstance.closeHandler (node_modules/mongodb-memory-server-core/src/util/MongoInstance.ts:513:10)
```

This error indicates that the MongoDB Memory Server instance is exiting unexpectedly before it's fully initialized, causing all tests that depend on database operations to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to one of the following:

1. **Environment Configuration**: The MongoDB Memory Server may not have the necessary system dependencies installed or configured correctly.
2. **Version Compatibility**: There might be compatibility issues between the versions of MongoDB Memory Server, Mongoose, and Node.js being used.
3. **Resource Constraints**: The MongoDB Memory Server might be failing due to insufficient system resources.

## Attempted Fixes

The following fixes were attempted:

1. Added error handling and debugging to the MongoDB Memory Server configuration in `tests/backend-tests/setup/db.js`
2. Configured MongoDB Memory Server with explicit database name and debug mode
3. Added proper error logging to help diagnose the issue

## Recommended Solutions

To resolve this issue, consider the following approaches:

1. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are up-to-date and compatible with each other:
   ```bash
   npm update mongodb-memory-server mongoose
   ```

2. **Install MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is properly installed on the system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
   ```

3. **Alternative Testing Approach**: Consider using a Docker container for MongoDB testing instead of MongoDB Memory Server:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
   ```

4. **Configure Test Environment**: Set up environment variables to use a dedicated test database instead of an in-memory database.

## Impact on Test Coverage

Due to this issue, the backend tests cannot properly connect to the database, resulting in:

- All database-dependent tests failing
- Inability to verify database operations
- Reduced test coverage for backend functionality

This issue does not affect the actual backend code functionality but prevents proper testing of the backend components.
